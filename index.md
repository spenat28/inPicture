## Vision

Motivation: **"One picture can be better than thousands of words..."**

Democratic information network. Like Spotify, but for information. Evolution in information sharing.

Sort of "fact-check" network, where multiple elected redactors has to agree about value of information to be displayed to public eyes.

Initiative to support **independent journalism** and free information to fight against disinformation and **expose connections** between events, citations and political structures.

With love to truth, democracy and freedom with independency and distributed system built in.

Target is not to create new content. Target is to prevent existing content from getting lost from public sight, to be buried under populism and lies. And to be easily found at any time.

Built on trust, independency, freedom of speech and democratic voting.

## be part of this ...

I am open to discussion and suggestions. [Read part "The Plan"](#the-plan)

## 3 cruciral parts

* reader ( end-user application )
* databases ( servers )
* redactors ( unique per server )

## Basic principles

* Every node and link has to be supported by source - exception is adding people and groups.
* Connected to social media by UUID hashtags. _Nothing less, nothing more._
* Every node will be locked in time - to preserve they value that they had in that time.
* Decentralized and democratic system based on voting.
* Every information has to have English translation.
	* This initiative considers English to be universal language, hence all information has to be available in it - with no exception.
	* _(? this is maybe not necessary, maybe even counter-productive ... it is an idea, which is less important)_

## Name

Simple play on words and fact, that graphs are pictures, i think powerful enough. And works in every language.

## The Plan

* Together with one tweet & Twitter vote poll
* Contact @EdwardSnowden and @JohnOliver

	* and @JohnOliver aproval
	* because i believe in them
* Or/And:
